## Why is this Project Important?
The ride-sharing industry relies on scale, efficiency, and customer trust. Platforms like Tranzit-Ride must balance rider convenience, driver earnings, and platform profitability while addressing challenges such as seasonal demand fluctuations, cancellations, uneven earnings distribution, and low digital payment adoption.  

Analyzing operations data enables identification of trends, optimization of workflows, and development of actionable strategies to improve performance across trips, revenue, drivers, and riders.

---

## Background
The analysis focuses on four main areas:
- **Trips & Demand Patterns**: Trip volumes, cancellations, and peak periods.
- **Revenue & Payments**: Revenue sources, commission structure, and payment preferences.
- **Driver Analysis**: Earnings distribution, fleet composition, and completion rates.
- **Rider Analysis**: Rider segmentation, spending behavior, and engagement levels.

---

## Tools Used
- **SQL Server**: Used to query and extract raw data directly from the company's operational database, enabling accurate analysis and reporting.  
- **Excel**: Supported data exploration and creation of a data dictionary.  
- **Power BI Desktop/Service**: Connected to SQL Server for data modeling and interactive dashboard creation.  
- **Power BI Service**: Enabled publishing and sharing dashboards for real-time insights across stakeholders.

## Key Insights
- Strong mid-year demand with post-summer decline.  
- Weekends underperform compared to weekdays.  
- Trip demand aligns with commute hours.  
- Revenue is volume-driven; commission rates stable.  
- September revenue dip indicates seasonal/operational issues.  
- Card usage strong; wallet adoption low.  
- Driver earnings concentrated among top performers.  
- Heavy reliance on Sedans limits service diversity.  
- Completion rates good but cancellations remain significant.  
- Most riders are Standard tier; few upgrade to premium.  
- Small group of riders drives disproportionate revenue.

## Recommendations
- Launch targeted promotions during low-demand months (Sepâ€“Oct).  
- Introduce weekend incentives (discounts, loyalty points).  
- Partner with corporate clients for consistent commuter trips.  
- Investigate September earnings dip via trip volumes and cancellations.  
- Promote wallet adoption with bonuses, cashback, and loyalty credits.  
- Explore dynamic pricing during peak months.  
- Analyze top driver strategies and replicate across the fleet.  
- Implement driver mentorship programs and bonus schemes for low cancellations.  
- Expand fleet diversity with more SUVs and Minis.  
- Launch tier upgrade campaigns and loyalty programs for high-spend riders.  
- Reactivate inactive riders with personalized campaigns.
